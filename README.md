# Mini Data-Analysis Project: Breast Cancer Dataset

## About this repository
This repository contains my exploratory data analysis project for STAT 545A. The project explores a breast cancer dataset to investigate differences between benign (harmless) and malignant (harmful) tumors, using numeric measurements such as tumor size, texture, and other characteristics.

## How to engage with this repository
- All analyses are written in R Markdown (`.Rmd`) and can be reproduced by knitting the file.
- The project includes data exploration, visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, boxplots), and research questions about tumor characteristics.
- To explore the results:
  1. Open the R Markdown file (`mini-project-1.Rmd`) in RStudio.
  2. Install required packages (`datateachr`, `tidyverse`) if needed.
  3. Knit the `.Rmd` file to view the analysis in HTML or Markdown format.

This repository is structured for clarity and reproducibility, so that anyone familiar with STAT 545A can follow the analysis and reasoning behind the exploration of the dataset.
