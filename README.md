## About this repository
This repository contains my exploratory data analysis project for STAT 545A. The project explores a breast cancer dataset to investigate differences between benign (harmless) and malignant (harmful) tumors, using numeric measurements such as tumor size, texture, and other characteristics.

## How to engage with this repository
- All analyses are written in R Markdown (`.Rmd`) and can be reproduced by knitting the file.
- The project includes data exploration, visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, boxplots), and research questions about tumor characteristics.
- To explore the results:
  1. Open the R Markdown file in RStudio.
  2. Install required packages (`datateachr`, `tidyverse`) if needed.
  3. Knit the `.Rmd` file to view the analysis in HTML or Markdown format.
